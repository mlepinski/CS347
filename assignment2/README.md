## Goals for Assignments 1 and 2

Here are my goals for assignment 1 and assignment 2:

- Provide a bit more practice with Flask
- Provide a first experience with Docker
- Provide an example of machine-to-machine communication using JSON and an HTTP API
- Provide an experience writing code that is part of a larger project
- Provide an experience integrating code writen by different people
- Provide an opportunity to think critically about the design of APIs used for machine-to-machine communication

## Overview of the System

Goal is to watch two AI play games against each other

Three components of the system

## Assignment Two

Requirements:

- Must have three docker containers
- Must be able to watch multiple games at once in different tabs
- Must make legal moves and correctly stop when the game is over
- Must be tested and largely free of bugs

You wrote code to Component 1. Your collegues wrote code for Component 2. I (Matt) wrote code for component 3. I am emailing you the code for components 2 and 3.

You may need to edit some code that you didn't write. Please keep the AI strategy/algorithm as similar as possible. (Don't completely re-write the AI's, use the AI strategies from Assignment 1). 

Please ask me if you have any questions. For the purposes of this project, I am a senior collegue who is contributing code to a sytem that you are working on.

## Reflective Writing

Writing should address these two questions

1. Thinking about the design of the API. What lessons can you take forward to design better APIs in the future

2. Thinking about integrating code written by different people. What should developers do to make integration of the pieces as easy as possible
3.
