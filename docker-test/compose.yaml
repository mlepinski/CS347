# This starts two services
# The first is called "web" and uses the Dockerfile in the ./web directory
# Port 80 on the real machine forwards to Port 5000 in the "web" container

# The second service is called "api" and uses the Dockerfile in ./api
# This service exposes port 5000 to other docker container machines
# ... However, no ports are available to the real machine
